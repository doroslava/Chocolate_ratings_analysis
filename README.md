# Chocolate ratings Analysis

This is Assignment for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree: : Write a Data Science Blog Post  


To run the scipts you will need following libaries:
 * pandas
 * numpy
 * country_convert (https://pypi.org/project/country-converter/)
  
  
  In the project directory you will find:    
  * Jupyter Notebook file with the analysis  
  * .csv file with the data for analysis
  
  ## Project motivation
  The Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset includes ratings for different chocolate bars, together with more detailed information on tested chocolates, such as manufracturer or origin of specific bean. In this analysis, we would like to get preliminary idea what makes the best chocolate. We want to infere if the rating depends on some of the characteristics related to production of chocolate. For example, we are interested if the rating of chocolates depends on origin of chocolate bean or percentage of cocoa. This could be a starting point for further analysis and collection of more specific data on chocolate production.
